<p align="center">This is a trivia card application for the streamer "Alexelcapo"</p>
<br/>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Editor</h3>
<p>You can create, remove and edit themes which are essentially groups, they have a name and a color so you can easily identify them. You can also create cards that contain the trivia questions, assign them a theme, type the question and the options and set which one is correct.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Cards</h3>
<p>This section is for randomly selecting a car of a specific theme or grouping them all, the selected card will be shown in the middle of the screen, the options will appear in random order and you'll have to select which one is correct. Once it's done, the options will change their color depending on if you failed or succeeded, pressing anywhere else on the screen will bring you back to the main menu.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Dice</h3>
<p>The dice is just that, a random number generator, the difference with a normal dice is that you can dynamically change its range, press the roll button to see in what number lands on.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Import/Export</h3>
<p>The import and export system works with the JSON format but you don't need to care about that, just press export, copy the text and save it in a file for when you want to import it back.</p>
